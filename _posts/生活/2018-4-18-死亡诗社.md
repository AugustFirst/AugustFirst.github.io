* > &ensp;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not
learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover
that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life,
living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless
it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all
the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to
put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and
shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to
its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then
to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish
its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know
it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it
in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are
in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the
devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that
it is the chief end of man here to "glorify God and enjoy
him forever."  
-Henry David Thoreau:Walden,or Life in the Woods
> 我到林中去，因为我希望谨慎地生活，只面对生活的基本事实，看看我是否学得到生活要教育我的东西，免得到了临死的时候，才发现我根本就没有生活过。我不希望度过非生活的生活，生活是那样的可爱；我却也不愿意去修行过隐逸的生活，除非是万不得已。我要生活得深深地把生命的精髓都吸到，要生活得稳稳当当，生活得斯巴达式的，以便根除一切非生活的东西，划出一块刈割的面积来，细细地刈割或修剪，把生活压缩到一个角隅里去，把它缩小到最低的条件中，如果它被证明是卑微的，那么就把那真正的卑微全部认识到，并把它的卑微之处公布于世界；或者，如果它是崇高的，就用切身的经历来体会它，在我下一次远游时，也可以作出一个真实的报道。因为，我看，大多数人还确定不了他们的生活是属于魔鬼的，还是属于上帝的呢，然而又多少有点轻率地下了判断，认为人生的主要目标是“归荣耀于神，并永远从神那里得到喜悦”。（徐迟译）  
* 　学会自己思考，学会欣赏文学和语言。不管别人怎么说，文学和语言的确能改变世界。  
    Learn to think for yourselves again. No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world。
* (梭罗)我步入丛林／因为我希望生活得有意义／我希望活得深刻／吸取生命中所有的精华／把非生命的一切都击溃／以免当我生命终结／发现自己从没有活过  
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.To put to rout all that was not life, and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived。
* 用不同的眼光来看待事物。  
we must constantly look at things in a different way。
* 你们必须努力寻找自己的声音，因为你越迟开始寻找，找到的可能性就越小。  
Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all。
* 做一个世界的水手，游遍所有的港口。  
To be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports。
* 我要做生活的主宰，而不是奴隶。  
Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave。
* 我们都有一种被人接受的需要。但是你必须坚持自己的信仰是独特的是你自己的，哪怕别人认为它们很怪，或者很讨厌，哪怕一群人都说，那太差。  
we all have a great need for acceptance. But you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go。
* 要敢于逆流而上。  
Swim against the stream。
