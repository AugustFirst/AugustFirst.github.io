* &ensp;In 1784,five years before he became president of the United States,George Washington,52，was nearly toothless.So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw--having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.
* &ensp;That's far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books.But recently,many historians has begun to focus on the slavery played in the lives of the founding generation.They have been spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998,which almost certainly improved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings.And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up.Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation's early leaders and the fragile nature of the country's infancy.More significantly,they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong--and get most did little to fight it.
* &ensp;More than anything,the historian see,the founders were hampered the culture of their time.While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery,they also understood that it was part of the political and economic, bedrock of the country they helped to create.
* &ensp;For one thing,the South could not afford to part with its slaves.Owning slaves was "like having a large bank account",says Wiencek,author of An Imperfect God:George Washington,His slaves and the Creation of America.The Southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the "peculiar institution",including a clause that counted asleep a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.
* &ensp;And the statesmen's political lives depended on slavery.The three-fifths formula handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of1800 by inflating the votes of the Southern states in the Electoral College.Once in office,Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803,the new land was carved into 13 states,including three slave states.
* &ensp;Still,Jefferson freed Hemings's children--though not Hemings herself or his approximately 150 other slaves.Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War,overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will.Only a decade earlier,such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.

* &ensp;1784年，在乔治·华盛顿当选美国总统的5年前，52岁的他牙齿几乎都掉光了，因此他雇了一个牙医为他移植了9颗牙————这些牙齿是从他的奴隶口中拔下来的。
* &ensp;乔治的这一行为和许多人在历史书上读到过的那个砍樱桃树的形象大不相同。最近，许多历史学家开始关注奴隶制在美国开国元勋生活中扮演的角色，他们在某种程度上受到了在1998年获取的DNA证据的激励，这些证据几乎证明了托马斯杰斐逊和他的奴隶萨莉海明斯，至少生过一个孩子。学者们只是在近30年才彻底的研究了这段历史。一些历史学家的著作，揭示了早期开国元勋们的道德沦丧，以及美国在建国初期所表现出的脆弱本质。更值得注意的是，这些历史学家认为很多开国元勋们知道奴隶制是错误的————但他们大多数人基本上并未采取措施废除奴隶制。
* &ensp;这些历史学家们认为，最重要的是那些开国元勋们受制于他们所处时代的文化。虽然华盛顿和杰斐逊都在私底下表示讨厌奴隶制，但他们也知道奴隶制是他们创建的这个国家的政治和经济基础的一部分。
* &ensp;一方面，南方各州无法承担废除奴隶制带来的损失。拥有奴隶，”就像拥有一个数额巨大的银行账户”，《一个不完美的上帝：乔治华盛顿，他的奴隶和美国的诞生》，一书的作者维瑟克说道，倘若没有对这种“特殊制度”的保护，南方各州就不会在宪法上签字，宪法中的一项条款规：，在计算国会代表人数时，一个奴隶可以算作3/5个公民。
* &ensp;此外，政治家的政治前途也依赖于奴隶制度，3/5准则增加了南方各州在选举团中的选票，从而帮助杰斐逊在1800年的总统选举中险胜，杰斐逊一上任就通过路易斯安那购买协议，在1803年扩大了奴隶制范围，这片新置的土地后来被分为13个州，其中有三个州实行奴隶制。
* &ensp;尽管如此，杰斐逊还是解放了海明斯的孩子————但并没有解放海明斯本人，也没有解放他的其他约150名奴隶。华盛顿在美国独立战争期间，目睹了黑人士兵的勇敢之后，开始相信每个人生来都是平等的，他不顾亲人的强烈反对，立下遗嘱给予奴隶自由。而仅仅在十年前，这一举措在弗吉尼亚州是需要得到立法批准的。
