&ensp;The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England.According to the standard history of American philosophy,nowhere else in colonial America was "so much importance attached to intellectual pursuits."According to many books and articles,New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding,dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.
&ensp;To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects that we may not neglect.But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life,We may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture,adjusting to New World circumstance.The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
